Included is the "RubyRobot" gem implementing the Netflix Studio Engineering 
Take-home (backend) code exercise.

This project uses the ruby bundler.  Navigate into 'ruby_robot' and run

bundle install

to install dependencies for this gem.

The gem sources include a Rakefile.  The default rake task will run the 
RSpec test suite (please note: I learned RSpec while implementing this
code, so I'm sure my usage is far from idiomatic).

In the 'ruby_robot', directory run

rake -T

to see a list of available tasks.

Run 

rake 

to run the RSpec tests.

Run 

exe/ruby_robot

to start the REPL shell.  Alternately, run "rake install:local" to build the 
gem and install it locally.  If that is done 'ruby_robot' should be on the 
path without providing the full path to it. 'ruby_robot' supports 'tab' 
completion.  Whack tab a few times to see the supported commands.

Also, be advised that the 3rd argument to the 'place' command should be 
uppercase NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST.

An additional command is supported in the REPL, that being 'QUIT' to exit the 
REPL.

To interact with the classes, run 

bin/console 

from the 'ruby_robot' directory to run IRB w/ the RubyRobot gem preloaded.
