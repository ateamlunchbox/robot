I think one of the first things to do is decide objects. 

My initial stab is to have Robot and Tabletop since those were called out
in the spec.

Then I thought that maybe I could do the whole thing with just Robot.  However,
there is state info for Robot (orientation) and state info for Tabletop (position).  
I could see that future iterations could include a tabletop that is a different
width/height than 5x5, there could be an iteration where there are multiple 
robots on a single tabletop (and I'm making the assumption that only one robot
can be at a Tabletop position at a time).

Also, I can see that there could be multiple Tabletops with a single Robot.  The
Robot could be placed on one Tabletop, move around, and then be placed on a 
separate Tabletop (with the same orientation state) and continue to move.

I'll continue with Robot and Tabletop as the objects.
